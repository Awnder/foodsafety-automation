# Food Safety Automation

ðŸ‘‹ Hey! This is a short snippet of code that I used to automate procedures for my part-time job at Veg-Fresh Farms.

A lot of what I did was repetative (part-time work at its finest). So I figured I should automate it! 
The process is now integrated into the Excel sheet that the Food Safety team uses for all their communication regarding 400+ vendors with over 1000+ farms total, saving around 15 minutes per week!

Anyways, that's all! ðŸ«¡ ~Andrew
